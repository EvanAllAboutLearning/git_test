    I am building this website to assist in my learning of full stack development. The goal will be to eventually learn new skills to make myself more marketable; I love my current job but I want to grow my organization beyond what they believe they are capable. 
    <p> 
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        My first order of business will be to create an ordered list:
        <ol>
            <li> item 1 </l1>
            <li> item 2 </li>
        And then, I'd like to create a cute little hyperlink:
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About the Odin Project"
        </ol>
